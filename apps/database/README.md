# Database

The Dockerfile is quite simple. It uses the official PostgreSQL 14 image based on Alpine as the base image.

## Getting started

To build the image, run the following command:

```bash
yarn workspace @aeg-poc/database build
```

Afterwards, everytime you need to run it, you can use the following command:

```bash
yarn workspace @aeg-poc/database start
```
